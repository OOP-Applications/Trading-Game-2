# Trading Game

The trading game takes place over a ten day span. The player attempts to make
money buying and selling apples and pears. (I'm suddenly reminded of playing
Oregon Trail on an Apple IIE.) We will be working through this project in teams:

1. **Ryan and Joseph** ```main``` method.
2. **Preston and Lukas** The transactional methods:
    a. ```sellApples```
    b. ```sellPears```
    c. ```buyApples```
    d. ```buyPears```
3. **Heath and Justin**
    a. Constants \& Global Variables
    b. ```printMenu```
    c. ```currencyFormatter```
4. **Daniel and Rumaish**
    a. ```getChoice```
    b. ```computePrice```
    c. ```getQuantity```


Once we get it working, we will talk about refactoring, and changes that we
want to make. We will end the project by documenting our code and doing Java doc
for our methods.
